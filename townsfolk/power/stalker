**Stalker** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Each day, the Stalker may assign two extra votes to a player in the current day’s polls.
__Details__
Each day, the Stalker may threaten a player. That player will have 2 more invisible votes against them on the daily polls. These additional votes are revealed when the polls close. The threatened player is privately notified of the threat and added to a channel.
Threatening a player is an immediate ability. The Stalker can anonymously talk to the person they’re threatening. At the end of the day the player is removed from the channel and the invisible votes are removed (even if the Stalker is dead at that point).
The Stalker may select themself. The Stalker is not affected by redirections.

__Simplified__
Each day, the Stalker may assign two extra votes to a player in the current day’s polls. They will be able to anonymously talk to the person they selected.
