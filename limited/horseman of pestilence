**Horseman of Pestilence** | Solo Power - Horsemen Team
__Basics__
Each night, the Horseman of Pestilence may doom a player. To sick to act, that any attempt of that player to use an ability during the night will fail
__Details__
Dooming a player is an immediate effect. For the rest of the night, any attempts to use an ability will fail for that player. For some abilities, this may be indistinguishable from other failures (attacks), while others have no other way of failing (investigations).
When the Horseman of Pestilence attempts to doom another Horseman it fails and the two Horsemen unite, joining a shared channel. Doomed players are informed that they have been doomed, but not which Horseman doomed them.
When all remaining Horseman are united and all remaining players doomed, Doomsday is unleashed. Once that happens, the Horseman of Pestilence turns into an Apocalyptic Horseman, with the ability to kill a player each night. The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Horseman of Pestilence may doom a player, blocking their ability for the night. If they attempt to doom another Horseman they instead join a shared channel. When all players are doomed, each Horseman may kill a player every night. The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.
