**Amulet Holder** | Townsfolk Killing | Limited
__Actions__
At the start of the game, the Amulet Holder is the first holder of the *Amulet of Protection*. Whoever holds the amulet is protected from attacks during the night, but must pass it to another player during the day.
__Basics__
Up to three players may be named to which it is attempted to pass the amulet. Selecting players to pass the amulet to is an immediate day effect, but passing it is an end day effect. The amulet cannot be passed to someone who has previously held it and attempting to do so will result in a failure, attempting the next player on the list. The holder may initially provide less than three players and then add additional players to the list later. The holder of the amulet cannot die under any circumstances during the night, but may die during the day. Should that happen, the amulet is lost.
Holders of the amulet do not know who gave them the amulet, nor do they know who has previously held it.
If the holder of the amulet does not or cannot choose a player to pass the amulet to, it shatters at the end of the day, killing the holder.
Holders of the amulet keep their role and do not change into an Amulet Holder.
The Amulet Holder must pass the amulet during Day 0.
Once per game, the Amulet Holder may choose to immediately shatter the amulet during the day, immediately killing the holder. 

__Simplified__
At the start of the game, the Amulet Holder is the first holder of the *Amulet of Protection*. Whoever holds the amulet is protected from attacks during the night, but must pass it to another player on the following day. Each player can only hold the amulet once, and if no players remain that may hold the amulet, it shatters, killing the current holder. The Amulet Holder may shatter the amulet destroying it and killing the holder.
