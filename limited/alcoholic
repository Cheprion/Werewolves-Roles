**Alcoholic** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The Alcoholic spends the night drinking at the tavern and thus is absent for any attacks on them.
__Details__
During the night, the Acoholic is fully immune against all attacks targeting them, however they may still be killed by other means.
The Alcoholic cannot exist without a Bartender, and loses their power as soon as the Bartender dies. The Alcoholic dies at the end of the first night without a living Bartender.

__Simplified__
At night, the Alcoholic is immune against all attacks (but not kills), but dies when the Bartender dies.
